<p>Generative Design for Spatial Layout ofUrban NeighborhoodBy: Abhishek PalitScholar No. 19510002Guided By: Prof. Saptarshi KolaySynopsisAimTo create a generative design methodology for spatial layout of neighborhood, that incorporatesdifferent variables and parameters as a set of defined measurable goals and generates differentdesign options that can be evaluated to achieve the optimum solution.Objectives1.Literature Review of the Generative Design Approach.2.Site Study and Analysis.3.Identification of parameters and goals and creation of a generative algorithm that integrates arule-based geometric system and a series of measurable goals and parameters and generatesmulti variate scenarios.4.To evaluate the generated scenarios and select the optimum design option.Generative Design for Spatial Layout of Urban NeighborhoodBy : Abhishek PalitSynopsisLiterature ReviewSite AnalysisProject DevelopmentImplementationResultsConclusionSynopsisScopeo Includes the scale of a neighbourhood in two selected cities.o The tools for the computation will include parametric software Revit Dynamo.o Computationalalgorithmthusgeneratedwouldoutputautomatedlayoutsoftheneighbourhood for the selected study area.o The study will also compare the computer-generated layouts to the existing layout of theneighbourhoods of the study area.Limitationso Limited to a general statement by one city, for validation of the computational algorithm.o The generative algorithm will be based on the parameters and goals majorly identified throughthe analysis of the study areas.Generative Design for Spatial Layout of Urban NeighborhoodBy : Abhishek PalitSynopsisLiterature ReviewSite AnalysisProject DevelopmentImplementationResultsConclusionSynopsisGenerative Design for Spatial Layout of Urban NeighborhoodBy : Abhishek PalitSynopsisLiterature ReviewSite AnalysisProject DevelopmentImplementationResultsConclusionMethodologyGenerative Design for Spatial Layout of Urban NeighborhoodBy : Abhishek PalitNeighborhood Design ConceptsSynopsisLiterature ReviewSite AnalysisProject DevelopmentImplementationResultsConclusionRadburn Model by Clarence Stein and Henry WrightNeighborhood Concept - Radburn Model by Clarence Stein and Henry Wright➢Four to six superblocks commonly formed aneighbourhood that was bounded by major roadsor natural features.➢At one end of the parkway there could be a smallschool with community rooms.➢Roadsintheneighbourhoodweretobehierarchical - major through traffic roads to bordereach neighbourhood, distributor roads to surroundeach superblock,andculs-de-sactoprovideaccess to individual property lots.Generative Design for Spatial Layout of Urban NeighborhoodBy : Abhishek PalitNeighborhood Design ConceptsSynopsisLiterature ReviewSite AnalysisProject DevelopmentImplementationResultsConclusionNeighborhood Unitby Clarence PerryPerry identified six neighbourhood unit design principles.➢First, the unit was to be ideally a shape in which all sideswere equidistant from the centre, and its size was to be fixed.➢Secondly, a central neighbourhood or community centre wasto contain various institutional sites, including a school,grouped round a central green space.➢Thirdly, local shops or shops and apartments were to belocated at the outer corners of the neighbourhood.➢Fourthly, scattered small parks and open spaces, located ineach quadrant of the neighbourhood, were to form 10 percent of the total area.➢Fifthly, arterial streets were to bound each side of theneighbourhood while ,➢sixthly, the layout of the internal street was to be acombination of curvilinear and diagonal roads to discouragethrough traffic. Vehicular and pedestrian traffic was to besegregated.Neighborhood Unit Concept by Clarence PerryGenerative DesignThe evolutionary process in nature (Darwin's finches or Galapagos finches.
